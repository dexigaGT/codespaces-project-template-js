# RC Cyber Truck Project

## Introduction

This project involved designing and building a remote-controlled cyber truck that could withstand high-impact crashes. The goal was to create a durable RC vehicle using advanced machining techniques and materials.

## Background

RC cars are typically made from plastic or lightweight metals, but for this project, I wanted to create something much more robust. The cyber truck design was chosen for its angular, futuristic aesthetic and the challenge of machining complex geometries.

## Design Process

### Materials Used
- Aluminum alloy for the chassis
- Steel reinforcements
- High-strength polymers for body panels
- Brushless motor system

### Machining Techniques
- CNC milling for precision parts
- Laser cutting for body panels
- 3D printing for prototyping

## Construction

The build process took several months and involved:

1. CAD modeling of all components
2. Machining metal parts to tight tolerances
3. Assembly and testing
4. Crash testing and iterations

## Results

The final vehicle successfully withstood multiple high-speed crashes without significant damage. The project demonstrated the importance of material selection and engineering principles in RC vehicle design.

## Conclusion

This project taught me valuable lessons in mechanical engineering, from design to manufacturing. The cyber truck serves as a testament to the power of combining traditional machining with modern design tools.
